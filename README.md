# Natural Language Processing Models in PyTorch

1. Simple Word Embedding Model

- for sentiment analysis to classify movie reviews as positive or negative
- ConceptNet Numberbatch: sets of pretrained word embeddings

input: xs.shape = 1411 reviews â†’ xs.shape = (1411, 300)
ys.shape = (1411, 1)
Test accuracy: 97.9%

2. Learning Word Embeddings

- learn the word embeddings
